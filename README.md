# BlenderPythonWork
A WIP repo for my current Python blender projects. Used for some current graphics work for addons, programming in 3D space, and others.
For my actual 3D portfolio, please see: https://jhensondev.com

Current Version of Blender: 3.0.1


## Current Work: Attempting to experiment with propagation of objects in a 3D space based on python input parameters. 
## Goal: To be able to model logistic regression/linear regression of machine learning models based on Python input.

- # Current Python WIP: city_with_lights.py
- Produces: Populates a grid of cubes with random height variance like a city, populates glass materials to random cubes, and will place point lights in these cubes. Point lights/glass cubes randomly based on a 20% distribution (with a 50% chance of these point lights being either blue or pink), randomly selected depending on input parameters
- Result: ![City With Lights](/city_with_lights.png "city_with_lights") 
Note, this result has a point light added for aesthetics
